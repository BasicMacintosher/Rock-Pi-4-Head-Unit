# Rock-Pi-4-Head-Unit
Build an Rock Pi 4b powered car head unit

!! This Project is Work in Progress!!

I bought a Rock Pi 4 with the intention to build a Car head unit for my Ford Fiesta MK4. 
Follow me on my journey through this project. 

I downloaded the official Android image for the Rock Pi 4. In my case, I bought the Rock Pi 4 model b as it was the only one available for purchase thanks to the chip shortage.

The reason I went with Android 7 is that it runs faster on the Rock Pi and since it just serves as a base for the Project I didn't really care that it was outdated. From a security standpoint I'm not worried at all because it is not connected to the internet, so it doesn't matter. 

After the image was installed on the SD card I downloaded the Application that is needed to run the dongle I bought 
Dongle: https://amzn.eu/d/6gC4eBJ
App download: 121.40.123.198:8080/AutoKit/AutoKit.apk (the link is also on the box)

At this time, I could only test the setup on an 42-inch TV because my touch display didn't arrive jet. When i receive it, I will test it with the display and then 3D Print a box enclosure to test the setup in my Car and use it while I'm driving. 
For now, it works fine on the TV. 

The only thing to consider is, that if you have Wi-Fi somewhere, and you are planing to use it, the CarPlay dongle works over Wi-Fi so the connection to your home Wi-Fi will get disconnected. I don't think this is a huge bummer, but maybe a thing to note since I don't have Cellular data at my place.

The touch display did arrive and it worked flawlessly.
